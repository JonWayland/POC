SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 – 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE
  The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
  development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
  efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
  open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
  with others.

  The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
  redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
  fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
  redistributed and sold with any software provided that any reserved
  font names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
  however, cannot be released under any other type of license.

   Holder under this license and clearly marked as such.
